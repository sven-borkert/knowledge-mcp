## Documentation Standards Maintained

1. **Consistency**: All documents use consistent formatting and structure
2. **Code Examples**: All code examples tested and working
3. **Cross-references**: Documents link to each other appropriately
4. **Completeness**: All aspects of the TypeScript implementation documented
5. **Accessibility**: Quick reference for fast lookup, detailed guides for learning

## Next Steps

The documentation is now fully updated to reflect the current TypeScript implementation. Future updates should:

1. Keep examples in sync with code changes
2. Update test results when new tests are added
3. Document any new features or tools
4. Maintain the migration guide as differences emerge
5. Keep the quick reference current with common commands

All documentation accurately reflects Knowledge MCP Server v0.1.0 (TypeScript implementation).
