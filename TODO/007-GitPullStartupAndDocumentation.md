# 007 - Git Pull on Startup and Documentation Updates

## Overview

Implement git pull functionality on MCP server startup to sync with remote repositories before local operations, and update all documentation to reflect current implementation including git origin setup instructions.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Code Implementation

游릴 TASK completed - Add pullFromOrigin() utility function to utils.ts
游릴 TASK completed - Add pullFromOriginAsync() utility function to utils.ts  
游릴 TASK completed - Modify initializeStorageAsync() to include git pull before local operations
游릴 TASK completed - Add proper error handling for pull failures (network, auth issues)
游릴 TASK completed - Add logging for pull operations in server startup

### Phase 2: Documentation Updates

游릴 TASK completed - Update README.md with Git Remote Setup section
游릴 TASK completed - Add warning about local changes being overwritten on startup to README.md
游릴 TASK completed - Update technical-specification.md with startup pull behavior documentation
游릴 TASK completed - Update technical-specification.md Git Integration section
游릴 TASK completed - Update error-handling-guide.md with pull-related errors

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation

游릴 TASK completed - Build project and fix any TypeScript errors
游릴 TASK completed - Test startup with no remote configured
游릴 TASK completed - Test startup with remote configured
游릴 TASK completed - Test startup with network issues simulation
游릴 TASK completed - Verify all documentation matches implementation

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance

游릴 TASK completed - Run pnpm run fix:all to ensure code quality
游릴 TASK completed - Run pnpm run test:interface to verify functionality
游릴 TASK completed - Verify no breaking changes to existing MCP tools
游릴 TASK completed - Update status flags to completed (游릴) upon successful completion

## Implementation Notes

### Git Pull Strategy

- Use `git fetch origin main` followed by `git reset --hard origin/main`
- This overwrites local changes to prevent merge conflicts
- Only pull if remote origin exists (using existing hasGitRemote function)
- Log warnings on pull failures but don't block startup

### Documentation Requirements

- Add prominent Git Remote Setup section to README.md
- Warn users that local changes will be overwritten on startup
- Update technical specification with new startup sequence
- Document error handling for network/auth failures

### Files to Modify

- `src/knowledge-mcp/utils.ts` (add pull functions and modify initializeStorageAsync)
- `README.md` (git remote setup instructions)
- `docs/technical-specification.md` (startup behavior and git integration)
- `docs/error-handling-guide.md` (pull-related errors)

### Quality Gates

- All TypeScript must compile without errors
- All existing tests must pass
- Code formatting and linting must pass
- Documentation must be accurate and complete
